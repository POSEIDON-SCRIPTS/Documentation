<details>

<summary><strong>üìã Prerequisites</strong></summary>

Before beginning the installation process, ensure you have:

* **POS-Core** properly installed and running (required)
* **Server access** with file modification permissions
* **Keymaster** access for script downloads
* **Recent server backup** (highly recommended)
* **Database access** for table import

{% hint style="danger" %}

{% endhint %}

</details>

## Installation Steps

<details>

<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-Farming, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-Farming.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üì¶ Step 2: Download and Install POS-Farming</strong></summary>

Download and install the POS-Farming script:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-Farming** script
3. Extract the downloaded files
4. Place the `POS-Farming` folder inside your `[POS]` directory

```
[POS]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Farming/        ‚Üê Add this folder
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Import Database Tables</strong></summary>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Database Step**: The script requires specific database tables to function properly.
{% endhint %}

Import the required database structure:

1. Navigate to the `[POS]/POS-Farming/sql/` folder
2. **Open** your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, etc.)
3. **Select** your server's database
4. **Import** or **execute** the SQL file(s) found in the sql folder

```sql
-- Example: Execute the SQL file in your database
-- This will create the necessary tables for POS-Farming
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Database Tools**: You can use phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or the command line to execute the SQL files.
{% endhint %}

**Verify Database Import:**

* Check that new tables have been created in your database
* Look for tables with names starting with `pos_farming_` or similar
* Ensure no errors occurred during the import process

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 4: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-Farming` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-Farming       ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-Farming loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Configure POS-Farming</strong></summary>

Configure POS-Farming to your liking:

1. Navigate to `resources/[POS]/POS-Farming/shared/config.lua`
2. **Review** and **modify** the configuration settings as needed
3. **Configure** the following key settings:
   * **Plant Configuration**: Set up available plants and their growth requirements
   * **Zones**: Configure farming zones and restrictions
   * **Items**: Define water buckets, fertilizer items, and tools
   * **Growth Settings**: Configure plant growth times and conditions
   * **Discord Webhooks**: Set up logging for farming activities
   * **Commands**: Admin commands for zone management
4. **Save** your changes

```lua
Config.Plants = {
    ['corn_harvest'] = {
        item = 'corn_cob',
        amount = {
            min = 2,
            max = 6
        },
        required = {
            water = true,
            fertilizer = true,
        },
        removeAfterHarvest = true,
        time = 1800, -- 30 minutes
        type = 'corn',
        description = 'Golden corn stalks that produce nutritious corn cobs.',
        seedChance = 45,
        temp = {
            min = 15,
            max = 35,
        }
    },
}

Config.BucketItems = {
    ['galeata_goala'] = {
        value = 50, -- water to increase
        uses = 3, -- how many times can you water before empty
    }
}

Config.FertilizerItems = {
    ['fertilizant'] = {
        value = 50, -- fertilizer to increase
    }
}
```

5. **Navigate** to `resources/[POS]/POS-Farming/shared/config.js`
6. **Configure** the language settings:

```javascript
TR = {
    LANG: 'EN',
    EN: {
        GROWTH: "Growth", 
        FERTILITY: "Fertility",
        WATER: "Water",
    },
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Configuration**: Review all available options in both config files and adjust them to match your server's needs. This includes plant types, growth requirements, zone settings, and UI language.
{% endhint %}
