# POS-TimeSync Installation Guide

## POS-TimeSync Time & Weather Synchronization System

## Framework Independent

Welcome to the complete installation guide for POS-TimeSync. This advanced time and weather synchronization system provides comprehensive time/weather management for your RedM server and works seamlessly with the POS ecosystem.

***

## Prerequisites
<details>

<summary><strong>üìã Prerequisites</strong></summary>

Before beginning the installation process, ensure you have:

* **POS-Core** properly installed and running (required)
* **Server access** with file modification permissions
* **Keymaster** access for script downloads
* **Recent server backup** (highly recommended)

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Requirement**: POS-Core must be installed before POS-TimeSync. POS-TimeSync depends on POS-Core for core functionality.
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Installation Steps

<details>

<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-TimeSync, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-TimeSync.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üì¶ Step 2: Download and Install POS-TimeSync</strong></summary>

Download and install the POS-TimeSync script:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-TimeSync** script
3. Extract the downloaded files
4. Place the `POS-TimeSync` folder inside your `[POS]` directory

```
[POS]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-TimeSync/       ‚Üê Add this folder
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 3: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-TimeSync` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-TimeSync      ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-TimeSync loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Configure POS-TimeSync</strong></summary>

Configure POS-TimeSync to your liking:

1. Navigate to `resources/[POS]/POS-TimeSync/shared/config.lua`
2. **Review** and **modify** the configuration settings as needed
3. **Configure** the following key settings:
   * **Time Settings**: Enable/disable time synchronization
   * **Weather Settings**: Configure weather patterns and real-world weather
   * **Pattern Settings**: Define custom weather patterns
   * **Commands**: Admin commands for time/weather management
4. **Save** your changes

```lua
Config = {
    -- Time synchronization settings
    UseTime = true,  -- Whether to use the in-game time synchronization system
    RealTime = false,  -- Whether to use real-world time
    DayDuration = 4 * 3600,  -- Duration of the in-game day (in seconds)
    NightDuration = 2 * 3600,  -- Duration of the in-game night (in seconds)
    
    DefaultTransition = 5000.0,  -- Default transition time for weather and time changes

    -- Weather synchronization settings
    UseWeather = true,  -- Whether to use weather synchronization
    CityRealWeather = 'Bucharest',  -- City name for real-time weather data
    RealWeatherCache = 180,  -- Time to cache real-world weather data
    
    -- Weather pattern settings
    WeatherPattern = false,  -- Default weather pattern
    SnowInWeatherSnow = true,  -- Snow on ground when weather is snowy
    DayTime = {6, 18}  -- Daytime hours range
}
```

5. **Configure Weather Patterns**:

```lua
Config.Pattern = {
    Cycle = 60000,  -- Time to cycle weather patterns (in ms)
    
    Patterns = {
        Christmas = {
            weather = {
                'sunny', 'sunny', 'snow', 'overcast', 'sunny', 'misty', 'snow', 'fog'
            },
            transition = 15 * 1000,  -- 15 seconds transition
            snow = true,  -- Snow will be on the ground
        },
        
        Summer = {
            weather = {'sunny', 'sunny', 'sunny', 'clouds', 'thunderstorm'},
            transition = 15 * 1000,
            snow = false,
        },
        
        Apocalypse = {
            weather = {'hurricane', 'thunderstorm', 'sandstorm', 'blizzard'},
            transition = 15 * 1000,
            snow = false,
        },
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Configuration**: Review all available options in the config.lua file and adjust them to match your server's needs. This includes time cycles, weather patterns, and real-world weather integration.
