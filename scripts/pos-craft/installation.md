## Installation Steps

<details>

<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-Craft, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-Craft.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üì¶ Step 2: Download and Install POS-Craft</strong></summary>

Download and install the POS-Craft script:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-Craft** script
3. Extract the downloaded files
4. Place the `POS-Craft` folder inside your `[POS]` directory

```
[POS]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Craft/          ‚Üê Add this folder
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Import Database Tables</strong></summary>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Database Step**: The script requires specific database tables to function properly.
{% endhint %}

Import the required database structure:

1. Navigate to the `[POS]/POS-Craft/sql/` folder
2. **Open** your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, etc.)
3. **Select** your server's database
4. **Import** or **execute** the SQL file(s) found in the sql folder

```sql
-- Example: Execute the SQL file in your database
-- This will create the necessary tables for POS-Craft
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Database Tools**: You can use phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or the command line to execute the SQL files.
{% endhint %}

**Verify Database Import:**

* Check that new tables have been created in your database
* Look for tables with names starting with `pos_craft_` or similar
* Ensure no errors occurred during the import process

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 4: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-Craft` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-Craft         ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-Craft loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Configure POS-Craft</strong></summary>

Configure POS-Craft to your liking:

1. Navigate to `resources/[POS]/POS-Craft/shared/config.lua`

   * **Categories**: Organize crafting items into categories
   * **Discord Webhooks**: Set up logging for crafting activities
4. **Save** your changes
