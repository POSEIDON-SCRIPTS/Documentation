<details>

<summary><strong>üìã Prerequisites</strong></summary>

Before beginning the installation process, ensure you have:

* **POS-Core** properly installed and running (required)
* **Server access** with file modification permissions
* **Keymaster** access for script downloads
* **Recent server backup** (highly recommended)
* **Database access** for table import

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Requirement**: POS-Core must be installed before POS-Zombie. POS-Zombie depends on POS-Core for core functionality.
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Installation Steps

<details>

<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-Zombie, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-Zombie.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üì¶ Step 2: Download and Install POS-Zombie</strong></summary>

Download and install the POS-Zombie script:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-Zombie** script
3. Extract the downloaded files
4. Place the `POS-Zombie` folder inside your `[POS]` directory

```
[POS]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Zombie/         ‚Üê Add this folder
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Import Database Tables</strong></summary>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Database Step**: The script requires specific database tables to function properly.
{% endhint %}

Import the required database structure:

1. Navigate to the `[POS]/POS-Zombie/sql/` folder
2. **Open** your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, etc.)
3. **Select** your server's database
4. **Import** or **execute** the SQL file(s) found in the sql folder

```sql
-- Example: Execute the SQL file in your database
-- This will create the necessary tables for POS-Zombie
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Database Tools**: You can use phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or the command line to execute the SQL files.
{% endhint %}

**Verify Database Import:**

* Check that new tables have been created in your database
* Look for tables with names starting with `pos_zombie_` or similar
* Ensure no errors occurred during the import process

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 4: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-Zombie` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-Zombie        ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-Zombie loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Configure POS-Zombie</strong></summary>

Configure POS-Zombie to your liking:

4. **Save** your changes

```lua
Config.SafeZone = {
    show = true,

            playing = false,
            delay = 0,
            lastStart = 0
        },
    },
    walks = {
        {"default", "very_drunk"},
        {"murfree", "very_drunk"},
        {"default", "dehydrated_unarmed"},
    }
}
```

5. **Configure Looting System**:

```lua
Config.Looting = {
    enabled = true,
    deleteAfterLoot = true,
    chances = {
        money = 30,
        item = 50,
        receiveBoth = 20,
    },
    
    moneyAmounts = {
        min = 1,
        max = 100
    },

    itemList = {
        { name = "WEAPON_PISTOL_MAUSER", amount = 1, chance = 2 }, 
        { name = "empty_bucket", amount = 1, chance = 20 }, 
        { name = "apple_seeds", amount = 1, chance = 78 }, 
    }
}
```

6. **Configure Airdrop System**:

```lua
Config.AirDrops = {
    enabled = true,
    velocity = -0.5,
    cooldown = { 60000, 120000 },
    deleteAfterLoot = true,
    notification = true,
    locations = {
        [1] = {
            prop = {
                model = 'p_toolshed02x',
                offset = -6.5
            },
            blip = {
                model = 'blip_mission_area_bounty',
                size = 25.0,
                modifier = 'BLIP_MODIFIER_AREA'
            },
            coords = {
                vector4(2395.3281, -1369.6479, 44.7530, 55.6714)
            },
        }
    },
}
```

7. **Navigate** to `resources/[POS]/POS-Zombie/shared/configs/zombies.lua`
8. **Configure** zombie models and health:

```lua
Config.Zombies = {
    {
        model = 'CS_MrAdler',
        outfit = 1,
        health = 300,
    },
    {
        model = 'CS_ODProstitute',
        outfit = 0,
        health = 300,
    },
    {
        model = 'CS_SwampFreak',
        outfit = 0,
        health = 300,
    },
    -- Add more zombie configurations as needed
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Configuration**: Review all available options in both config files and adjust them to match your server's needs. This includes zombie behavior, safe zones, loot systems, and airdrop mechanics.
