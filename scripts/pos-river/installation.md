## Installation Steps

<details>

<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-River, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-River.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üì¶ Step 2: Download and Install POS-River</strong></summary>

Download and install the POS-River script:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-River** script
3. Extract the downloaded files
4. Place the `POS-River` folder inside your `[POS]` directory

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 3: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-River` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-River         ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-River loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Configure POS-River</strong></summary>

Configure POS-River to your liking:

1. Navigate to `resources/[POS]/POS-River/shared/config.lua`
2. **Review** and **modify** the configuration settings as needed
3. **Configure** the following key settings:
   * **Water Locations**: Configure different water sources
   * **Interaction Settings**: Set up drink/shower/wash options
   * **Canteen Items**: Configure water containers
   * **Cure Items**: Set up medical items
   * **Controls**: Key bindings for water interactions
4. **Save** your changes

```lua
Config.WaterLocations = {
    [1] = {
        name = "Flat Iron Lake",
        waterhash = -1356490953,
        watertype = "lake",
        locationConfig = {
            Active = true,
            Options = {
                drink = true,
                shower = true,
                items = true,
            },
            WaterSettings = {
                increase = 25,
                duration = 10000,
                damage = {
                    enabled = true,
                    chance = 50,
                    value = 50,
                },
                poison = {
                    enabled = true,
                    chance = 50,
                    value = 5,
                    interval = {15000, 60000},
                }
            },
        }
    },
}
```

5. **Configure Canteen Items**:

```lua
Config.CanteenItems = {
    ["pleosca"] = {
        uses = 5,   -- How many uses the canteen has
        fillDuration = 10000, -- How long it takes to fill
        boilDuration = 10000, -- How long it takes to boil water
        model = "p_cs_canteen_hercule",
    }
}
```

6. **Configure Water Objects**:

```lua
Config.ObejectTypes = {
    ["p_barrel_wash01x"] = {
        locationConfig = {
            Active = true,
            Options = {
                drink = true,
                shower = true,
                items = true,
            },
            WaterSettings = {
                increase = 25,
                duration = 10000,
            }
        }
    }
}
```

{% hint style="info" %}
