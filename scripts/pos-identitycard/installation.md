<summary><strong>üìã Prerequisites</strong></summary>

Before beginning the installation process, ensure you have:

* **POS-Core** properly installed and running (required)
* **Server access** with file modification permissions
* **Keymaster** access for script downloads
* **Recent server backup** (highly recommended)

{% endhint %}

</details>

## Installation Steps

<details>

<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-IdentityCard, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-IdentityCard.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üì¶ Step 2: Download and Install POS-IdentityCard</strong></summary>

Download and install the POS-IdentityCard script:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-IdentityCard** script
3. Extract the downloaded files
4. Place the `POS-IdentityCard` folder inside your `[POS]` directory

```
[POS]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-IdentityCard/   ‚Üê Add this folder
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Import Database Tables</strong></summary>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Database Step**: The script requires specific database tables to function properly.
{% endhint %}

Import the required database structure:

1. Navigate to the `[POS]/POS-IdentityCard/sql/` folder
2. **Open** your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, etc.)
3. **Select** your server's database
4. **Import** or **execute** the SQL file(s) found in the sql folder

```sql
-- Example: Execute the SQL file in your database
-- This will create the necessary tables for POS-IdentityCard
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Database Tools**: You can use phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or the command line to execute the SQL files.
{% endhint %}

**Verify Database Import:**

* Check that new tables have been created in your database
* Look for tables with names starting with `pos_identitycard_` or similar
* Ensure no errors occurred during the import process

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 4: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-IdentityCard` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-IdentityCard  ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-IdentityCard loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}
