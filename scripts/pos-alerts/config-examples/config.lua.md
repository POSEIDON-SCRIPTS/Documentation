--- `CreateAlert` function for external use.
--- 
--- This function allows other resources to create alerts based on the provided data.
--- It validates the input data and ensures the alert ID exists in the configuration.
--- If valid, it creates an alert and returns `true`. Otherwise, it logs an error and returns `false`.
---
--- ### Parameters:
--- - `data` (table): A table containing the alert data.
---   - `data.id` (string): The unique identifier for the alert. Must exist in `Config.JobAlerts`.
---   - `data.source` (number, optional): The source player ID creating the alert.
---   - `data.coords` (vector3, optional): The coordinates of the alert. Defaults to the player's current position.
---   - `data.name` (string, optional): The name of the alert reporter. Defaults to the player's name.
---
--- ### Returns:
--- - `boolean`: `true` if the alert was successfully created, `false` otherwise.
---
--- ### Example Usage:
--- ```lua
--- local success = exports['POS-Alerts']:CreateAlert({
---     id = "police_alert",
---     source = 1, -- do not use source and coords together, use one of them
---     coords = vector3(123.45, 678.90, 21.0), -- or use source to get the player's position and name
---     name = "John Doe"
--- })
---
--- if success then
---     print("Alert created successfully!")
--- else
---     print("Failed to create alert.")
--- end
--- ```
