# POS-Metabolism Installation Guide

## POS-Metabolism Survival System

## Framework Independent

Welcome to the complete installation guide for POS-Metabolism. This advanced survival system provides comprehensive metabolism mechanics including hunger, thirst, temperature, and hygiene for your RedM server and works seamlessly with the POS ecosystem.

***

## Prerequisites
<details>

<summary><strong>üìã Prerequisites</strong></summary>

Before beginning the installation process, ensure you have:

* **POS-Core** properly installed and running (required)
* **Server access** with file modification permissions
* **Keymaster** access for script downloads
* **Recent server backup** (highly recommended)
* **Database access** for table import

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Requirement**: POS-Core must be installed before POS-Metabolism. POS-Metabolism depends on POS-Core for core functionality.
{% endhint %}

</details>

## Installation Steps

<details>

<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-Metabolism, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-Metabolism.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üì¶ Step 2: Download and Install POS-Metabolism</strong></summary>

Download and install the POS-Metabolism script:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-Metabolism** script
3. Extract the downloaded files
4. Place the `POS-Metabolism` folder inside your `[POS]` directory

```
[POS]/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Metabolism/     ‚Üê Add this folder
```

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Import Database Tables</strong></summary>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Database Step**: The script requires specific database tables to function properly.
{% endhint %}

Import the required database structure:

1. Navigate to the `[POS]/POS-Metabolism/sql/` folder
2. **Open** your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, etc.)
3. **Select** your server's database
4. **Import** or **execute** the SQL file(s) found in the sql folder

```sql
-- Example: Execute the SQL file in your database
-- This will create the necessary tables for POS-Metabolism
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Database Tools**: You can use phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or the command line to execute the SQL files.
{% endhint %}

**Verify Database Import:**

* Check that new tables have been created in your database
* Look for tables with names starting with `pos_metabolism_` or similar
* Ensure no errors occurred during the import process

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 4: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-Metabolism` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-Metabolism    ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-Metabolism loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Step 5: Configure POS-Metabolism</strong></summary>

Configure POS-Metabolism to your liking:

1. Navigate to `resources/[POS]/POS-Metabolism/shared/config.lua`
2. **Review** and **modify** the configuration settings as needed
3. **Configure** the following key settings:
   * **MaxHealth**: Maximum player health
   * **HudSettings**: Configure metabolism elements (food, water, temperature, etc.)
   * **Items**: Set up consumable items and their effects
   * **ClothesTemperature**: Configure clothing temperature values
   * **VoiceChat**: Set voice chat integration
   * **Commands**: Admin commands for metabolism management
4. **Save** your changes

```lua
Config.MaxHealth = 600

Config.HudSettings = {
    food = {
        enabled = true,
        decrease = 0.02,
        decreaseWhileRunning = 0.06,
        damage = 20,
        time = 5000
    },
    water = {
        enabled = true,
        decrease = 0.03,
        decreaseWhileRunning = 0.08,
        damage = 20,
        time = 5000
    },
    temperature = {
        enabled = true,
        time = 10000,
        damage = 15,
        coldValue = -10,
        hotValue = 40,
    },
}

Config.Items = {
    ["alcool"] = {
        playerStats = {
            water = 20,
            food = 0,
            health = 50,
            alcohol = 10,
            stress = -20,
        },
        animation = "drink",
    },
}
```

5. **Navigate** to `resources/[POS]/POS-Metabolism/shared/config.js`
6. **Configure** the HUD settings and language:

```javascript
TR = {
    LANG: 'EN',
    EN: {
        SAVE: "Save SETTINGS ", 
        HUD_STYLE: "üéÆ HUD STYLE",
        COLOR_SETTINGS: "üåà COLOR",
        SETTINGS: 'SETT<span style="color: white">INGS</span>',
    }
}

Config = {
    IconType: 3, // Change this 1, 2, 3
    icons: {
        health: {
            show: true,
            box: {
                text: true,
                icon: 'fa-solid fa-heart',
                mainColor: '#f44336',
            }
        },
        // ... other icon configurations
    }
};
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Configuration**: Review all available options in both config files and adjust them to match your server's needs. This includes metabolism rates, item effects, HUD appearance, and language settings.
{% endhint %}
