```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}

<summary><strong>üóÑÔ∏è Step 3: Import Database Tables</strong></summary>

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Database Step**: The script requires specific database tables to function properly.
{% endhint %}

Import the required database structure:

1. Navigate to the `[POS]/POS-Backpacks/sql/` folder
2. **Open** your database management tool (phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, etc.)
3. **Select** your server's database
4. **Import** or **execute** the SQL file(s) found in the sql folder

```sql
-- Example: Execute the SQL file in your database
-- This will create the necessary tables for POS-Backpacks
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**Database Tools**: You can use phpMyAdmin, HeidiSQL, MySQL Workbench, or the command line to execute the SQL files.
{% endhint %}

**Verify Database Import:**

* Check that new tables have been created in your database
* Look for tables with names starting with `pos_backpacks_` or similar
* Ensure no errors occurred during the import process

<summary><strong>üîß Step 4: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-Backpacks` after POS-Core:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-Backpacks     ‚Üê Add this line here
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Load Order is Critical:** Make sure POS-Backpacks loads after POS-Core but can load before or after other POS scripts.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>
