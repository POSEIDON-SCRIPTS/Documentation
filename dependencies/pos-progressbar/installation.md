<summary><strong>üöÄ Step 1: Verify POS-Core Installation</strong></summary>

Before installing POS-ProgressBar, ensure POS-Core is properly installed:

1. Navigate to your `resources/[POS]/` folder
2. Verify that `POS-Core` folder exists
3. Check that POS-Core is running without errors in your server console

```
resources/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [POS]/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ POS-Core/        ‚Üê This must exist
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Important**: If POS-Core is not installed, please install it first before proceeding with POS-ProgressBar.
{% endhint %}

Download and install the POS-ProgressBar dependency:

1. Access your **Keymaster** account
2. Download the **POS-ProgressBar** script
3. Extract the downloaded files

{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>üîß Step 3: Update Server Configuration</strong></summary>

Configure your server.cfg with the proper load order:

1. Open your `server.cfg` file
2. **Add** `ensure POS-ProgressBar` **after** POS-Core but **before** other POS scripts:

```cfg
# POS Scripts
ensure POS-Core
ensure POS-ProgressBar   ‚Üê Add this line after POS-Core
ensure POS-[OtherScripts]
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Critical Load Order**: POS-ProgressBar must load AFTER POS-Core but BEFORE all other POS scripts that depend on it. This is essential for proper functionality.
{% endhint %}

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Configure POS-ProgressBar</strong></summary>

Configure POS-ProgressBar to your liking:

1. Navigate to `resources/[POS]/POS-ProgressBar/shared/config.lua`
2. **Review** and **modify** the configuration settings as needed
3. **Configure** the following key settings:
   * **StopKey**: Set the key to cancel progress bars
4. **Save** your changes

```lua
Config = {}

Config.StopKey = 0x156F7119 -- Backspace (default)
```

{% hint style="info" %}
