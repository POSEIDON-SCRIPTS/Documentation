# Welcome to our documentation!

Here you will find all the information about our script exports and configuration options. This documentation covers everything you need to get started and customize your experience.

**POS-Core** and other dependencies can be found either on our GitHub or by logging into our store with the account used for your purchase. Please note: it may take up to **5-10 minutes** for the **DEPENDENCIES** and **CUSTOMER SCRIPTS** to appear on the Tebex store after purchase. Just make sure you are logged into the correct account.
